/*A local variable is a variable that only exist in the area right
under the function.

function yeet(){
    var dab = readInt("Rate your litness on a scale of 1-10");
    println(dab);
}

the local variable is dab because it is right under the function.
In this example, the scope of the local variable is the funciton yeet
because the variable only exists in the first line of the yeet
function.
